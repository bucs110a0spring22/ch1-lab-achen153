## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
 Still getting used to coding. Confused on what a repl, readme.md, and main.py is and was wondering why a main.py and a readme.md are grouped together since the read.me seems unrelated to the main.py. Main.py is used to run code whereas README.md is used to store notes on a repository?
